# wfweb

**wfweb** is a fork of [wfview](https://gitlab.com/eliggett/wfview) that adds a built-in web interface for browser-based remote control and real-time audio streaming. It is aimed at users who want to operate their radio from a phone, tablet, or any browser — without installing any client software.

## About wfview

wfview is an outstanding open-source front-end for Icom, Kenwood, and Yaesu amateur radio transceivers. Written in C++/Qt by Elliott H. Liggett W6EL, Phil E. Taylor M0VSE, and contributors, it provides a rich desktop GUI with waterfall display, full radio control, audio over LAN, rigctld emulation, and much more. It is one of the most capable and well-engineered radio control applications available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The wfview project is hosted on GitLab:
**https://gitlab.com/eliggett/wfview**

Since wfview is on GitLab and wfweb is on GitHub, GitHub's native fork mechanism cannot be used. This repository is a maintained fork that tracks upstream wfview and adds the web interface layer on top.

The web interface is served directly by the `wfview` binary over HTTPS (self-signed certificate). No separate web server is needed. Connect your radio, run `wfview` (the binary retains the upstream name), and open `https://<host>:8080` in any browser. On first visit, accept the browser's certificate warning.

## Quick start (headless, IC-7300 via USB)

Install the package, then create a configuration file:

```ini
# ~/.config/wfview/wfview.conf

[Program]
hasRunSetup=true
version=0.2.0

[Radio]
Manufacturer=0
RigCIVuInt=148
SerialPortRadio=auto
SerialPortBaud=115200
```

Then run:

```bash
wfview
```

Open your browser at `https://<host>:8080`.

### Key configuration parameters

| Key | Section | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hasRunSetup` | `[Program]` | Skip first-time setup dialog | `true` |
| `Manufacturer` | `[Radio]` | 0=Icom, 1=Kenwood, 2=Yaesu | `0` |
| `RigCIVuInt` | `[Radio]` | CI-V address (decimal). IC-7300=148 (0x94) | `148` |
| `SerialPortRadio` | `[Radio]` | Serial port, or `auto` | `/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| `SerialPortBaud` | `[Radio]` | Baud rate | `115200` |
| `AudioOutput` | `[LAN]` | **Optional.** Local server audio output device. Omit for browser-only use. | `hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0` |
| `AudioInput` | `[LAN]` | **Optional.** Local server audio input device. Omit for browser-only use. | `hw:CARD=CODEC,DEV=0` |

> Audio streams directly between the radio and the browser — no server-side audio configuration is needed for web operation. `AudioOutput`/`AudioInput` only affect playback and capture on the server machine itself. Use `aplay -l` / `arecord -l` to list ALSA devices if needed.

## Upstream relationship

wfweb tracks the upstream wfview `master` branch. The intent is to keep the delta small so that merging upstream improvements remains straightforward. Changes in wfweb are limited to:

- `src/webserver.cpp` / `include/webserver.h` — web server implementation
- `resources/web/` — web frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- `resources/web.qrc` — Qt resource file for the web frontend
- Minor changes to `src/wfmain.cpp` for web server initialization
- This README and branding strings only (binary name and config path unchanged)
