# wfweb

**Control your Icom radio from any browser — phone, tablet, or desktop.**

wfweb turns your transceiver into a web-accessible station. Waterfall, SSB, CW decoding, FT8/FT4, [FreeDV digital voice](https://youtu.be/AWdHcyiOOnY), RADE, and AX.25 packet (APRS, connected QSOs, file transfer) — all in the browser, no client software required.

## Getting started

There are three ways to run wfweb. Pick the one that matches your setup:

1. [**Native build, USB radio**](#1-native-build--usb-radio) — any supported Icom connected by USB cable (most common)
2. [**Native build, LAN radio**](#2-native-build--lan-radio) — radios with built-in Ethernet (e.g. IC-7300 Mk2, IC-9700) or a LAN accessory
3. [**Docker**](#3-docker) — zero-install, multi-arch image for either USB or LAN radios

In every case, once wfweb is running you open `https://<host>:8080` in your browser and accept the self-signed certificate warning.

### 1. Native build — USB radio

Download a pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](../../releases) for your platform, plug in your radio, and run:

```bash
./wfweb
```

That's it — any supported Icom (IC-7300, IC-7300 Mk2, IC-7610, IC-705, IC-9700, IC-7100, IC-7410) is auto-detected over USB at its default CI-V address.

If you've changed your radio's CI-V address to something non-standard, pass it explicitly:

```bash
./wfweb --civ 0x94   # hex (as shown on the radio), or decimal (148)
```

### 2. Native build — LAN radio

For Icoms with a built-in Ethernet port (IC-7300 Mk2, IC-9700, IC-7610, …) or a LAN accessory, specify the IP and credentials on the command line:

```bash
./wfweb --lan 192.168.1.100 --lan-user admin --lan-pass secret
```

Replace the IP and credentials with your radio's settings. If your radio uses a non-default CI-V address, add `--civ 0x<addr>`.

### 3. Docker

No build, no dependencies. The image `k1fm/wfweb` is multi-arch (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) — it runs on x86 servers, Raspberry Pi, and everything in between.

**LAN radio (e.g. IC-7300 Mk2 via Ethernet):**

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  k1fm/wfweb --lan 192.168.1.100 --lan-user admin --lan-pass secret
```

**USB radio** (share the serial device and sound subsystem with the container):

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --device /dev/snd --group-add audio \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  k1fm/wfweb
```

See [Docker details](#docker-details) below for USB audio, custom serial ports, and building the image locally.

## FreeDV and RADE digital voice

wfweb is the first web-based transceiver interface with built-in [FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) support. Operate FreeDV digital voice modes directly from your browser — no additional software needed on the client side.

All FreeDV processing happens **server-side**: the server encodes and decodes modem tones in real time, so browser clients send and receive normal speech audio while the radio transmits and receives FreeDV signals over SSB.

### Supported modes

| Mode | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **RADE** | Radio Autoencoder | Next-generation ML-based codec using neural network inference for high-quality low-bitrate voice over HF |
| **700D** | Classic FreeDV | Proven HF digital voice, OFDM modem, works well on noisy channels |
| **700E** | Classic FreeDV | Improved 700D variant with better performance on fast-fading channels |
| **1600** | Classic FreeDV | Original FreeDV mode, FDM modem, robust on clean channels |

### How it works

```
RX:  Radio (modem tones) → FreeDV/RADE decode → speech audio → browser
TX:  Browser (speech) → FreeDV/RADE encode → modem tones → radio (SSB)
```

Select the FreeDV mode from the web UI, key up, and talk — wfweb handles the rest.

### Performance

RADE uses real-time neural network inference. Expect roughly **40% CPU usage** on a mid-range laptop (e.g. Intel i5-10310U @ 1.70 GHz). The classic FreeDV modes (700D/700E/1600) are much lighter and run comfortably on a Raspberry Pi.

## AX.25 packet — APRS, connected QSOs, and file transfer

A complete browser-based packet station: AX.25 frame monitor, connected-mode QSOs, APRS, and YAPP file transfer — no separate TNC, KISS bridge, or APRS client.

### What's included

| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Demodulators** | 300 baud AFSK • 1200 baud AFSK • 9600 baud G3RUH FSK |
| **Monitor** | Live AX.25 decode with sender, receiver, digipeater path, control field, and PID |
| **APRS** | Heard-stations table and beacon compose |
| **Terminal** | Connected-mode QSO to a peer station — chat, message-on-Enter |
| **File transfer** | YAPP send/receive over an established AX.25 connection |
| **Waterfall** | Live RX spectrogram (FT8-style palette) with TX bursts marked in red |

### How it works

```
RX:  Radio (audio) → Direwolf demod → AX.25 stack → frames to browser
TX:  Browser (frame, beacon, file) → AX.25 → Direwolf modem → SSB/FM mic to radio
```

Packet runs entirely server-side using a built-in [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) modem. The browser renders the waterfall, displays the monitor, and exposes the APRS / Terminal tabs; the radio just sees a normal voice carrier.

Tune to a packet frequency in a voice mode (LSB/USB/FM/AM), open the **Packet** panel, pick the demodulator, and frames stream into the monitor as they decode. To open a connected QSO type the peer call, optional digipeater path, and press **Connect** — once `CONNECTED` shows you can send messages or push files via YAPP.

The shared station callsign (gear dialog) is reused across CW, FT8/FT4, FreeDV reporter, APRS, and the AX.25 link, so you set it once and every mode uses it.

## Command-line options

All settings can be passed as CLI flags. Run `wfweb --help` for the full list.

| Flag | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-s --settings <file>` | Settings .ini file | `~/.config/wfview/wfweb.conf` |
| `-p --port <port>` | Web server HTTPS port | `8080` |
| `-S --no-web` | Disable web server, enable rig server | web server enabled |
| `--lan <ip>` | Connect via LAN/UDP (enables LAN mode) | USB serial |
| `--lan-control <port>` | LAN control port | `50001` |
| `--lan-serial <port>` | LAN serial/CI-V port | `50002` |
| `--lan-audio <port>` | LAN audio port | `50003` |
| `--lan-user <user>` | LAN username | (empty) |
| `--lan-pass <pass>` | LAN password | (empty) |
| `--civ <addr>` | CI-V address (hex `0x94` or decimal `148`) | auto-detect (USB only) |
| `--manufacturer <id>` | 0=Icom, 1=Kenwood, 2=Yaesu | `0` (Icom) |
| `-l --logfile <file>` | Log to file | `/tmp/wfweb-*.log` |
| `-b --background` | Run as daemon (Linux/macOS) | foreground |
| `-c --clearconfig CONFIRM` | Reset all saved settings and exit | — |
| `-d --debug [file]` | Enable verbose debug logging (optionally to file) | off |

### About `--settings`

Most users never need this flag. wfweb normally stores **your** preferences (serial port, audio device, web-server port, LAN address and credentials, per-radio config, etc.) in the OS default location under your user profile. `--settings` just lets you point it somewhere else instead.

The file is created and managed by wfweb — you don't hand-write it. You edit settings through the web UI and wfweb persists them to whichever file you named.

**Common reasons to use `--settings`:**

- **Running multiple wfweb instances in parallel, one per radio.** Give each its own `--settings` file so they don't overwrite each other's config.
- **Docker or systemd deployments** where the default per-user location is inconvenient. Mount or install a config at a fixed, predictable path (e.g. `/etc/wfweb/station.ini`).
- **Named profiles** you can switch between or back up: `home.ini`, `contest.ini`, `portable.ini`, etc.

To create a fresh settings file, just run:

```bash
wfweb -s ./my-profile.ini
```

wfweb writes a file with sensible defaults on first run. After that, open the web UI and configure as usual — your changes are saved back to that file.

If all you need is to talk to a rig on a non-default CI-V address or a different manufacturer, you don't need `--settings` at all — use `--civ <addr>` and `--manufacturer <id>` directly.

> **Note:** `--settings` does **not** take `.rig` files. Those are CI-V command dictionaries for specific radio models that wfweb already loads automatically from its install's `rigs/` directory based on the radio it detects on the bus. You should never pass one on the command line.

### Debug logging

When reporting a bug, run wfweb with `--debug` and a log file to capture verbose diagnostics:

```bash
wfweb --debug /tmp/wfweb-debug.log --lan 192.168.1.100 --lan-user myuser --lan-pass mypass
```

This produces detailed, timestamped logs covering power on/off state transitions, VFO/split routing decisions, CI-V command traffic, and cache updates. Reproduce the issue, then share the log file with your bug report.

Without the filename argument, `--debug` writes to the default log location (`/tmp/wfweb-*.log`).

## Docker details

The [Getting started](#3-docker) section covers the common cases. These are extras.

### Custom serial port

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/ttyUSB1 \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  k1fm/wfweb --serial-port /dev/ttyUSB1
```

### IC-7300 (original) via USB on Linux with radio USB audio

The original IC-7300 connects via USB, which provides both a serial port and a USB audio codec. To route TX/RX audio through the radio, pass the serial device, the sound subsystem, and the `--audio-device` flag:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --device /dev/ttyUSB1 \
  --device /dev/snd --group-add audio \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 \
  k1fm/wfweb --serial-port /dev/ttyUSB1 --audio-device 'USB Audio CODEC'
```

Adjust `/dev/ttyUSB1` to match your system (`ls /dev/ttyUSB*` to find it).

### Building the image locally

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t wfweb .
docker run --rm -it --device /dev/ttyUSB0 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 wfweb
```
